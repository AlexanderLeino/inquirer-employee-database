//Questions for office Hours
// In the readme it discusses breaking up functions into a seperate file. Is that something that you would recommend as well
//In the documentation for the console table it discusses retrieving information using objects should I jsut use sequilizer.
//Then for my class names should I just use three classes()
//You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a `seeds.sql` file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier.
